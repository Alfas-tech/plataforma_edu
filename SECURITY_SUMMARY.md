   - Three-tier role system: Student â†’ Teacher â†’ Admin
   - Properly enforced across all layers
   - Teachers cannot delete content (verified)
   - Teachers can only edit assigned course versions (verified)

2. **Deletion Authorization**
   - Only administrators can delete courses, modules, and lessons
   - UI-level protection (delete buttons hidden from non-admins)
   - Use case-level protection (role validation)
   - Database-level protection (RLS in Supabase)

3. **User Management**

   - Prevents deleting the last administrator
   - Admin-only user creation and role changes
   - Comprehensive validation

4. **Teacher Assignment Control**

   - Added explicit null checks for profile
   - Added clarifying comments about admin access model
   - Updated tests to verify new validations

2. **Enhanced Lesson Deletion** (`DeleteLessonUseCase`)

## Permission Matrix

| Operation | Student | Teacher | Admin |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------|
| View published courses | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| Create course | âœ— | âœ— | âœ“ |
| Edit course | âœ— | âœ— | âœ“ |
| **Delete course** | âœ— | âœ— | **âœ“** |
| Create module (assigned version) | âœ— | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| Edit module (assigned version) | âœ— | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| **Delete module** | âœ— | **âœ—** | **âœ“** |
| Create lesson (assigned version) | âœ— | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| Edit lesson (assigned version) | âœ— | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| **Delete lesson** | âœ— | **âœ—** | **âœ“** |
| Manage users | âœ— | âœ— | âœ“ |

**Key Findings**:
- âœ… Teachers **CANNOT** delete modules or lessons (by design)
- âœ… Teachers **CAN** create and edit content in assigned versions only
- âœ… Only administrators can delete any content
- âœ… All permissions properly enforced at multiple layers

## Defense in Depth Strategy

The system implements security at 4 layers:

### Layer 1: UI/Client-Side
- Conditional rendering based on roles
- Delete buttons hidden from non-admins
- Appropriate error messages displayed

### Layer 2: Server Actions
- Authorization checks before calling use cases
- Role validation in all sensitive operations

### Layer 3: Use Cases (Primary Layer)
- User authentication verification
- Role and permission validation
- Resource ownership/assignment validation
- Business logic enforcement

### Layer 4: Database/Repository
- Row-Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- Database-level constraints
- Cascade deletion properly configured

## Security Test Scenarios Verified

### âœ… Scenario 1: Teacher Attempts Module Deletion
- **UI**: Delete button hidden âœ“
- **API**: Returns "Solo los administradores pueden eliminar mÃ³dulos" âœ“
- **Result**: Access denied at multiple layers âœ“

### âœ… Scenario 2: Teacher Edits Unassigned Course Version
- **Validation**: Checks `isTeacherAssignedToVersion()` âœ“
- **Error**: "No estÃ¡s asignado a esta versiÃ³n del curso" âœ“
- **Result**: Unauthorized access prevented âœ“

### âœ… Scenario 3: Admin Self-Deletion
- **Validation**: Checks if userId matches current user âœ“
- **Error**: "Cannot delete your own account" âœ“
- **Result**: Self-deletion prevented âœ“

### âœ… Scenario 4: Deleting Last Admin
- **Validation**: Counts all admin users âœ“
- **Error**: "Cannot delete the last administrator" âœ“
- **Result**: System integrity maintained âœ“

## Answers to Original Questions

### Q: "Â¿QuÃ© errores de lÃ³gica tiene la lÃ³gica de negocio?"
**A**: âœ… **No critical logic errors found**. The business logic is well-designed with appropriate validations. Minor improvements were made to enhance resource hierarchy validation in deletion operations.

### Q: "Â¿QuÃ© problemas de roles entre usuarios con ciertas funciones no podrÃ­a funcionar?"
**A**: âœ… **Roles work correctly**. The three-tier role system (Student â†’ Teacher â†’ Admin) is properly enforced:
- Teachers are correctly restricted from deleting content
- Teachers can only modify content in course versions they're assigned to
- Admins have full access with appropriate safeguards (cannot self-delete, cannot delete last admin)
- All role checks are enforced at multiple security layers

### Q: "Â¿QuÃ© funciones de eliminar no se estÃ¡n haciendo bien?"
**A**: âœ… **Deletion functions work correctly** with the following safeguards:
- **Authorization**: Only administrators can delete courses, modules, and lessons
- **Validation**: Resource existence and hierarchy validated before deletion
- **Protection**: Prevents admin self-deletion and deleting the last admin
- **Cascade**: Proper cascade deletion configured (course â†’ versions/branches/modules â†’ lessons)
- **UI**: Delete buttons hidden from unauthorized users
- **API**: Multiple layers of authorization checks prevent unauthorized deletions

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements

While the current system is secure, these enhancements could further improve security:

### 1. Audit Logging
- Track all deletion operations
- Track role changes
- Track user creations/deletions
- Store audit logs with timestamps and user IDs

### 2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Implement for admin accounts
- Require for sensitive operations
- Use time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Limit deletion operations per time period
- Protect against brute force attacks
- Prevent rapid successive deletions

### 4. Session Management
- Implement session timeout
- Track active sessions per user
- Force re-authentication for critical operations

### 5. Content Approval Workflow
- Require admin approval for teacher content before publishing
- Implement change tracking and diff viewing
- Add rollback capabilities for published content

---

## Conclusion

The educational platform implements a **robust, multi-layered authorization system** that follows security best practices:

âœ… **Defense in Depth** - Multiple security layers  
âœ… **Principle of Least Privilege** - Users have minimal necessary permissions  
âœ… **Role-Based Access Control** - Consistent role enforcement  
âœ… **Fail-Secure Defaults** - Denies access by default  
âœ… **Input Validation** - Validates all user inputs  
âœ… **Resource Ownership** - Verifies ownership/assignment before operations

### Final Verdict

**The system is secure and well-designed.** The analysis found no critical vulnerabilities or logic errors. Minor enhancements were made to improve validation robustness. The authorization model is consistently enforced across all application layers.
